# Introduction
Diversion and alternative courts are so complicated they warrant their own chapter. The terminology alone can be confusing, so when working with a jurisdiction it's good to define early on what the office means by a 'diversion' and whether it encapsulates pre-trial diversions as well as speciality courts such as drug or veterans court. Below are basic descriptions of the various programs, when they are typically offered, and common issues that arise when analyzing these programs.

## Pretrial Programs
  
### Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD)
Often used for juveniles, these programs allow police to take an individual directly to some diversion service such as a drug rehab center rather than to jail or a detention center. While charges may be brought against the person eventually, the general idea is to enable the person to avoid a formal arrest and the incident should never reach the prosecutor. 

### Diversions As A Matter Of Law
There is not a clear line differentiating between Diversions as a matter of law and PTI, but generally diversions as a matter of law are required in certain instances whereas PTI involves a determination by someone that an arrestee should enter a program. Where diversions as a matter of law are not required, they may be considered different than PTI because they usually don't involve significant oversight from the prosecutor office or other law enforcement, rather such diversions are usually an agreement between the arrestee and the State for the arrestee to meet a set of conditions within a given time frame. [INCLUDE REFERENCE TO TN LEGAL DIVERSIONS]. The reason these are so important is that these types of diversions and ultimately either dismissals or guilties make up a lot more of the system than people realize. The reason this is not realized, as discussed below, is because data accurately reflecting their use is not captured.

Diversions as a matter of law may require an arrestee to enter a guilty plea, but that is not always the case, some are "pre-plea" agreements. Where they do require a guilty plea, the plea is not the final disposition of the case - this is often one of the hardest issues to deal with in analyzing prosecutor data because there is often only one field for a disposition and the guilty plea is entered at the time of the diversion, but then may be later changed. 

#### Why would the disposition of a diversion change? 
Diversions as a matter of law, whether requiring a plea or not, consist of an agreement between the arrestee and the State for the arrestee to do something. In some cases this is very minor and bureaucratic. For instance, when a person is stopped and has an invalid license, the agreement can be to simply update one's license. In other instances, even for serious cases like assault, the agreement might be to avoid the victim and not be rearrested for six months. Regardless, the disposition of the case can change if the individual is successful. If the individual is successful, then the State carries out its side of the agreement - generally this is to agree to a withdrawal of the guilty plea (if there was one) and to dismiss the case. In other instances though, it may be to downgrade the charges to a lower level. If the individual fails the condition, then the original plea stays on the original charges and the arrestee is sent immediately to the sentencing/punishment phase of the court process - usually.

#### Why is this data so messy?
This data is generally messy for a number of reasons:

1. The Case Management System isn't able to capture the nuance of these cases. Generally, the case management system will allow a prosecutor to enter a disposition on a case (or on individual charges) and the expectation is that the disposition is always final. But in these cases, it's not. Furthermore, the vendor may not provide sufficient drop down options to even capture this information - if the dropdown only has options for diversion, plea guilty, and dismissal, without significantly more nuanced entries, how is a prosecutor supposed to code such cases? Are they a diversion initially and then change to a guilty plea or a dismissal based on the ultimate outcome? Or is it a guilty plea that then changes? Or a diversion no matter what?

2. Prosecutor offices do not have defined data entry practices to capture use of these diversions. Even where a Case Management System does permit someone to enter sufficient data to capture these diversions, prosecutor offices must have attorneys and staff enter data correctly to capture this - whether it be changing dipsosition codes after certain events, or entering specific disposition codes that accurately capture the use of these diversions. Almost no office has such clearly defined workflows and even fewer conduct regular data quality audits to ensure compliance. 

3. Prosecutor offices are conflicted as how to count these cases. Given that these cases often involve a guilty plea and a diversion there are different views as to what they "are". Political pressures on prosecutors often dictates as to whether offices consider these guilties (a tough on crime stance) or diversions (a rehabilitative approach). It becomes even harder to determine how to count them when the case is dismissed for successful diversion. At this point, the case can likely fall into all three buckets. This is very challenging then when calculating dismissal, diverison, or conviction rates. General suggestion - with perfect data - count these as diversions and then separately report the successful and unsuccessful rates for diversions.

4. There may not be mechanisms set up to monitor compliance with the agreement. Diversions as a matter of law are _usually_ for non-serious crimes. As such, many prosecutor offices barely, if at all, monitor compliance. If an arrestee is required to get their license renewed to be successful, prosecutor offices often don't have the time or care to follow up. There may be a court date to verify this, but often there is not. As such, in the data, the dispsotion may not reflect success or failure simply because that was never actually determined.

### Pre-Trial Interventions (PTI)
PTI programs are generally more involved that diversions as a matter of law, including having an evaluation as to whether someone is eligible for the program. The program usually includes some social services, such as drug or mental health counseling and is organized by a diversion coordinator in the prosecutor office. Importantly, PTI programs generally don't require a person to plea before being enrolled, but the case is not closed with a dismissal until the person successfully completes the program. Instead, the case remains open, but is transferred from a prosecutor to the diversion staff until and unless the person fails the program at which point it is transferred back to the prosecutor for prosecution.

## Alternative Courts
Most forms of speciality courts / alternatives to prosection include one or more of the following: educational classes, counseling, rehab, support groups, therapy, community service, restitution, curfews, and treatment programs. Typically when a defendant successfully completes a diversion program, the prosecutor will dismiss the criminal charges, which means there will not be a conviction. Similar to what is described above with respect to conditional pleas, to enter an alternative court often requires pleaing guilty to charges and agreeing to the programming in order to have the case dismissed. And similarly, issues with data entry and data quality affect monitoring of alternative court cases.

### Drug Court
  
### Mental Health Court

### Veteran's Court

## Issues with Diversion
While most prosecutor offices are interested in diversion programs and would like to use diversion more often, there are common, substantial issues with most programs such that diversion programs of all types are underutilized.
