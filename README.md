# Prosecutor Analytics

This is a repository for analysts interested or working in prosecutor data and 
for prosecutors with an analytical interest. This repository was created and is 
maintained by [Justice Innovation Lab](https://https://www.justiceinnovationlab.org/)and we welcome suggested changes and additions via github PR.

Since about 2015, many prosecutor offices began pursuing analytics to better 
understand crime in their communities, to monitor office performance, and to 
increase accountability to the public. While behind other public services such 
as education and health, this trend shows a real initiative to improve service
and included pioneering offices hiring internal and external researchers. While
the number of researchers, analysts, and prosecutors in the space is growing, it
is still relatively small. This repository is an effort to provide a space for 
our community and to give a starting place for those starting out.

## Repository Organization
This repo is intended to (1) provide resources that experienced analysts have 
developed for use by new analysts and offices and (2) through the GitHub 
discussions feature to provide a forum for continued discussions about 
prosecutor analytics.
