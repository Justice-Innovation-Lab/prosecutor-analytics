# Introduction
Diversion and alternative courts are so complicated they warrant their own chapter. The terminology alone can be confusing, so when working with a jurisdiction it's good to define early on what the office means by a 'diversion' and whether it encapsulates pre-trial diversions as well as speciality courts such as drug or veterans court. Below are basic descriptions of the various programs, when they are typically offered, and common issues that arise when analyzing these programs.

## Pretrial Programs
  
### Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD)
Often used for juveniles, these programs allow police to take an individual directly to some diversion service such as a drug rehab center rather than to jail or a detention center. While charges may be brought against the person eventually, the general idea is to enable the person to avoid a formal arrest and the incident should never reach the prosecutor. 

### Diversions As A Matter Of Law
  
### Pre-Trial Interventions (PTI)

## Alternative Courts
Most forms of speciality courts / alternatives to prosection include one or more of the following: educational classes, counseling, rehab, support groups, therapy, community service, restitution, curfews, and treatment programs. Typically when a defendant successfully completes a diversion program, the prosecutor will dismiss the criminal charges, which means there will not be a conviction.

### Drug Court
  
### Mental Health Court

### Veteran's Court
