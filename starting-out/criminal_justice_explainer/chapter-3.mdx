# Introduction
Most criminal justice agencies use third-party vendors for software to collect data. Many of the legacy systems lock data away and only allow for agencies to access data enmasse through either pre-built reports or by making requests to the vendor. Pre-built reports may return the data in a number of formats, including pdfs, that make manipulating the data difficult. These pre-built reports as well as requests to vendors rarely include complete disclosure of how the data was gathered i.e. what the specifics of the joins and filtering were and most agencies are unaware that their data is stored in databases with multiple tables that requires expertise to properly merge and gather.

Whether data systems across criminal justice agencies are linked such that incident reports from police are pushed directly to prosecutor agencies and the courts is jurisdiction dependent. Some jurisdictions also have a Criminal Justice Coordinating Council (CJCC) or similarly named body that is intended to help with coordination across agencies. These inter-agency bodies are often responsible for figuring out data integration, but often have little power and individual agencies disregard them when they want.

# Police data systems
Data for police departments is generally retained in at least two to three, though often more, databases - CAD, RMS, and possibly a FCC database.
