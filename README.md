# Prosecutor Template Dashboards

This is a repository of template dashboards using Power BI that is intended for prosecutor offices interested in publishing data externally or 
internally. These template dashboards are intended to help resource constrained offices and those looking for best practices to be able to quickly
set up dashboards once data is prepared.

Since 2015, prosecutor offices across the US have been pursuing greater transparency through the sharing of data regarding prosecution. In order
to share data publicly, offices need to determine what technology the office has access to in order to host the data and any local privacy laws
that affect what data can be shared. After addressing these issues, a jurisdiction needs to determine what data to share, namely what metrics
will be presented. A number of pioneering prosecutor offices as well as nonprofit organizations and universities have created different, though
largely similar metrics for the public. The template public-facing dashboards in this repository are designed around the (Prosecutor Performance
Indicator)[ecutorialperformanceindicators.org/#indicators] framework, but can be repurposed as needed.
