# Introduction
This is a guide to common data points and terminology around those data points in prosecutor analysis. The first few sections are intended for prosecutors and the non-technical to become acquanted with analytical/statistical concepts. The later sections are for describing various common metrics common to the prosecutorion space. For a fuller discussion of these and examples of such metrics, visit the [Prosecutor Performance Indicators](https://prosecutorialperformanceindicators.org/#indicators) (PPI).

## Units of Observation
There are three common units of observation for defendants in criminal justice data: charge (or warrant), case (or dci/def_case_index), defendant - in order of granularity. 

For some analysis we may also focus on the prosecutor or prosecutor unit, the arresting officer or agency, or the judge as the unit of observation.
Important Data Points
	Dates
Arrest, Filing, and Disposition date are the most common and important dates in prosecutorial data. Which date you choose for a given graphic will depend on the point of the graphic, but you should consider this closely as the implementation of CMS systems often creates cuts in the data such that you may not have any arrests before x date or any dispositions before y date, thus your data is strangely truncated for certain periods.

 ## Common Concepts

### Charge Ranking and Grouping
One of the most challenging and important initial tasks working with a jurisdiction is to group charge title/statutes into meaningful categories. Ideally, we create a few aggregations that highlight different important elements of crimes. Jurisdictions often don’t initially understand the groupings, want to have many categories, and want to flexibly change the categories depending on how they are feeling that day or the facts of some cases. We want to standardize this process as much as possible and highlight specific charge categories and characteristics that are salient to racial justice (we lay out our principles here.)

### Controls
There are several data fields that we think are important for establishing controls if we do any modeling (i.e. if we want to assess statistically significant differences across certain groups of defendants, charges, cases, etc). Some of these controls include a defendant’s race and gender, whether a defendant had prior arrests, whether a defendant had prior convictions, and how old the defendant is.

## Common Metrics
There are a number of other nonprofits that have sprung up recently that also work with prosecutor agencies to bring their data to life. The two largest are [Measures for Justice](https://www.measuresforjustice.org/portal) (MFJ) and the [Prosecutor Performance Indicators](https://prosecutorialperformanceindicators.org/#indicators) (PPI). Both have developed a standard set of metrics that they believe indicate the ‘health’ of a criminal justice system - you should visit their websites and review. In general though, the below metrics are the most common you will hear discussed in prosecutor offices.

### Dismissal Rate
This is the percentage of cases that are dismissed compared to the number of cases prosecuted. For the most part, cases or charges dismissed as part of a plea should be excluded, as are diverted cases. At times we also just focus on those that are dismissed by the prosecutor or those dismissed by the judge – judicial dismissals are a point of concern for some jurisdictions as they interpret it as a reprimand from the judge for even bringing the case.

### Conviction Rate
Conviction rates are the percentage of cases that result in guilty outcomes. This can be due to a jury trial finding the defendant guilty, a bench trial, or the defendant accepting a guilty plea. Typically, diversion involve an agreement to forego prosecution if the defendant successfully completes a program or agreement terms. If that happens, there is not conviction so this does not factor into the conviction rate.

### Time to X
There’s are several metrics around time such as number of days until filing/dismissal/disposition, etc. There are also metrics around time to bond out a defendant or talk to a victim - time variables that relate to human relations that are necessary in a case.
	
### Recidivism
Recidivism, the rate at which a person re-offends, is the most common statistic used to measure the ‘success’ of law enforcement agencies in improving public safety. This statistic can be defined in a variety of ways with different implications. In defining a recidivism metric, there are a number of considerations for the analyst to define at the outset:
1. What is the "initial" event - arrest or conviction? To define the denominator population, one must decide if it is all persons arrested or all persons convicted. Given varying dismissal rates across jurisdictions and crime type, this will significantly affect the population. For prosecutor offices, since prosecutors often decide between whether to dismiss or prosecute an individual it often makes sense to differentiate between people with their case dismissed (especially dismissed by the prosecutor) and those convicted of a crime.
2. What is the "initial" date? This determines when a person _could_ possibly recidivate. This is generally measured from the date of the arrest, the date of disposition, or the date of release. There are complications with each choice. If starting from the date of arrest, an individual might be served with arrest warrants for other, prior incidents while in pre-trial detention - this is a common data issue. If starting from the date of disposition, then the analyst likely needs accurate information as to whether the individual is incarcerated or not. If starting from the date of release this is fairly straightforward, but if working with prosecutors is often hard to get this data.
3. Is rearrest or a future conviction considered to be "recidivating"? Since many arrests do not end in conviction, for a variety of reasons from bad arrest, arrestee innocence, to other issues, it is an important choice as to whether one considers a second arrest to be recidivating or if a conviction is required. 
4. What is the time window to recidivate? Since after an initial event a person _could_ recidivate for the rest of their life, generally recidivism analysis is bucketed into windows of time after the initial event. The most frequent buckets are six month buckets after the initial event until two years at which point two+ years is bucketed together. Note - a plurality of people that will recidivate do so within the first three to six months.
5. Other considerations - 

	a. Is the individual detained? A person is less likely to reoffend if they are detained - pre-trial or post-adjudication - thus it's important to know for knowing when the window of possible recidivation starts.

	b. What counts as a reoffense? Beyond the consideration of whether to count rearrest or conviction, one must decide what type of incidents to consider as a reoffense. Some analyses only consider felony reoffense, some consider both misdemeanor or felony, but most do not include violations of probation/parole since such offenses are (1) minor and (2) the violation would not have happened but for the prior offense.

	c. Is the data you're working with limited by jurisdiction / geography? If you are working with a single jurisdiction and the data is limited to arrests or convictions within that jurisdiction, then you may miss reoffense events that happen outside the jurisdiction. This is especially true if an individual is moved outside the jurisdiction for incarceration and then does not return to the jurisdiction post-confinement. 

	d. Measuring recidivism for dismissed cases from the time of dismissal is likely easiest when using prosecutor data since individuals with dismissed cases almost immediately then reenter the pool of people that could recidivate without complications of incarceration. But these people are also often the lowest risk so it's a different risk pool than those convicted of a crime.
	
### Case Load
Case load is the number of cases handled in a given period by the entire jurisdiction, a particular unit, or an individual attorney.

### Ratio of Arrested to Population 
Comparing the percentage of people in different groups as a percentage of the total arrest population vs. the total population of the county is another common metric. This is a useful metric in identifying potential disparities by race, gender, age, or other features.
