This folder contains materials related to Justice Innovation Lab's approach to learning about the legal process in a jurisdiction 
and how information is exchanged across criminal justice partners. These materials will be updated on an ongoing basis as JIL 
improves and learns from partnerships with prosecutor offices and others. We welcome feedback and contributions to this work
including from prosecutors, data analysts, design thinkers, and others. 

If you are interested in this work and would like to support us, please contact us [here](https://www.justiceinnovationlab.org/contact-us). If you use these materials for any 
publication please cite our work.
