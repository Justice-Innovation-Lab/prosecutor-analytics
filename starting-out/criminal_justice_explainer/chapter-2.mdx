## Brady & Giglio
Two cases from the Supreme Court specifically ruled on the nondisclosure of evidence in a trial. The 1963 case [Brady v. Maryland](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/373/83/) and the 1972 case Giglio v. United States heavily influenced the structure of rules of evidence within a federal criminal trial, and the level of responsibility prosecutors have to disclose evidence. At large, the cases have established a framework for how courts evaluate the nondisclosure of evidence in a trial to ensure the upheld right to due process by the United States Constitution. 

Brady v. Maryland arose out of a 1963 conviction of John Brady and his companion of first degree murder. The two were sentenced to death in separate trials. Within Brady’s trial, he admitted that he took part in the crime, but asserted that his companion was the one who actually committed the murder. The prosecution had evidence in the form of a statement from Brady’s companion admitting to the murder, but did not inform Brady’s attorney of this statement. The Maryland Court of Appeals held that the prosecution’s suppression of this evidentiary statement was a violation of Brady’s due process rights. While the offense of first-degree murder was not lowered, the appeals court held the violation was sufficient to order a new trial regarding punishment. The Supreme Court agreed and held that the suppression of evidence by the prosecution that is favorable to the accused violates due process, whether or not the evidence surrounds the guilt or punishment of the accused.
