## Brady & Giglio
Two Supreme Court cases play a pivotal role in setting the rules for disclosure of evidence by law enforcement to a defendant in a criminal trial. The 1963 case [Brady v. Maryland](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/373/83/) and the 1972 case Giglio v. United States heavily influenced the structure of rules of evidence within a federal criminal trial, and the level of responsibility prosecutors have to disclose evidence. In general, the cases have established a framework for how courts evaluate the nondisclosure of evidence in a trial to ensure the right to due process as guaranteed by the United States Constitution. 

<ins>Brady v. Maryland</ins> arose out of a 1963 conviction of John Brady and his companion of first-degree murder. The two were sentenced to death in separate trials. Within Brady’s trial, he admitted that he took part in the crime, but asserted that his companion was the one who actually committed the murder. The prosecution possessed a statement in which the companion confessed to the killing but failed to share it with Brady’s attorney. The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that suppressing this evidence violated Brady’s due process rights. Although the court upheld Brady’s conviction, it ordered a new trial on sentencing. The Supreme Court affirmed the ruling and held that prosecutors violate due process when they withhold evidence favorable to the accused, regardless of whether it relates to guilt or punishment.

</section> The 1972 Supreme Court case [Giglio v. United States] (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/150/) expanded the legal obligations of prosecutors to disclose favorable evidence, with a particular focus on credibility and impeachment material related to key witnesses. While <ins>Brady v. Maryland</ins> had already established that withholding exculpatory evidence violates due process, Giglio clarified that this duty extends to evidence that might affect the credibility of a government witness. The ruling affirmed that any promise made to a witness, such as immunity or reduced sentencing, in exchange for testimony must be disclosed to the defense. The Court emphasized that such evidence, even if not directly exculpatory, is material to the fairness of the trial, and its suppression undermines the integrity of the verdict at large.

</section> The case arose after John Giglio was convicted of forging checks. A key government witness, an accomplice, testified against Giglio. Unknown to the defense or jury, the U.S. Attorney’s Office had promised the witness immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony. This agreement was not disclosed during the trial. Although the trial prosecutor claimed they did not know the promise, as another prosecutor had made it, the Supreme Court held that the entire prosecution team bears responsibility for disclosing such evidence. The Court concluded that nondisclosure of the immunity deal had deprived Giglio of a fair trial and warranted a new one.

</section> For analysts reviewing large volumes of criminal cases, Giglio brings forth the importance of tracing how evidence, especially agreements or inconsistencies involving government witnesses, is disclosed and used in trial records. Patterns of non-disclosure may signal systemic issues within prosecutorial offices. Recognizing violations similar to that of Giglio can help identify cases where verdicts may rest on compromised testimony, a critical factor when assessing the reliability of convictions at scale.
