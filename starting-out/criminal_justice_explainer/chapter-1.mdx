<section id="introduction">

## Introduction
From arrest to prosecution to sentencing, there are pivotal stages for all criminal proceedings that all jurisdictions share; though what parties are involved, language describing each event, and the exact details of each stage differ by jurisdiction. This criminal justice explainer is a living document that is meant as a brief introduction to the criminal justice system and its data. Often lawyers and law enforcement assume in conversation that those working with them understand and know how the system works and that there is uniformity across jurisdictions. Similarly, those working with data can often make assumptions about how the data was created, the intention of the creators, and that non-technical individuals understand how data is structured. All of this leads to misunderstandings that this document aims to mitigate.
As a general matter, **sections X to Y** outline what happens after an individual is stopped by the police - we are avoiding the term arrest as that has a specific legal meaning that confers certain rights to an individual - in order to help data analysts/scientists and the general public understand the process. This guide is not meant as comprehensive as there are plenty of great resources out there already, but it is intended as a process walk through of what actually happens in the criminal justice process. Below is a diagram from the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/media/image/45506) of the various stages of that process:

Most jurisdictions also have their own diagrams available on their websites like [SOL9's Roadmap to Justice](https://www.scsolicitor9.org/files/Roadmap-to-Justice.pdf).

<section id="arresting-a-person">

### Arresting a Person[^a]
Police can stop an individual if they have __reasonable suspicion__. To make an arrest, police officers must have probable cause[^1] that the individual has committed some crime. This probable cause standard is more than the reasonable suspicion[^2] needed to stop someone, but a lower threshold than what a prosecutor needs to prosecute a case. Prosecutors are expected to prove cases __beyond a reasonable doubt__. These different thresholds are what lead some cases to being dismissed by prosecutors and never prosecuted. Offices have different practices regarding whether they will prosecute a case even if they cannot meet their burden before proceeding, but most will only prosecute if they believe they can meet that higher standard.

Once an individual is stopped there are a number  of legal decisions that outline what constitutes an arrest, but in general you can think of an arrest as happening when the officer takes the person into custody. Officers generally stop someone based on criminal behavior they observe - sometimes using a pretextual stop[^3] - or because of a long term investigation or a call for service.

After an individual is arrested, they are generally taken to jail (jails are different from prisons – prisons are  where people are generally sent to serve longer sentences) where they are booked into the system. Jails are often maintained by different law enforcement agencies than the police, often sheriff’s departments. Arrestees might also be diverted at the point of arrest in jurisdictions with [Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) programs](https://www.leadbureau.org/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1671122494724927&usg=AOvVaw0xbHC6j8TySOw9IotGEGtv)[^4]. 

After booking:
* Police will present a case to a prosecutor to determine if the case should move forward. The presentation of the case varies by jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, the police’s incident report is automatically transmitted to the prosecutor office into their Case Management System (CMS)[^5] to allow the office to begin reviewing the evidence. Often prosecutors will go on to meet with officers for clarification or to request more evidence. In jurisdictions where the incident reports are not automatically transferred, the incident reports have to be transmitted in some way - often via email (or even fax machine). The reports are often then manually uploaded to the CMS or, in some cases, are only stored as print-outs in a physical file.
   * For a discussion on CMS go [here](https://github.com/Justice-Innovation-Lab/prosecutor-analytics/discussions/3)
* The arrestee will also appear  before a bond or detention court. Generally, this is required within 24 to 72 hours of an individual being arrested. At these hearings, prosecutors may be present depending on the jurisdiction and may argue for a certain bond or detention determination. The judges for these cases are setting bond, bail or some other form of pre-trial monitoring. 
* “Bond” and “bail” are often used interchangeably, but technically they are different things.  Bail is the provisional release of the accused charged with a crime awaiting trial by the deposit of security. A bond is an agreement in which a third party, i.e. bond agent or bondsman, accepts responsibility for the “bail” of the person under indictment. The person under indictment generally pays the bondman a non-recoverable amount (typically 5-10% of bail).  If a defendant cannot afford the bail amount, they are often detained pending trial.   
* Sometimes, in lower level offenses, courts will set a “personal recognisance bond” (PR bond), that only requires the defendant to commit to appearing in court.
* In cases where a prosecutor believes that the defendant is a danger to the community or will fail to appear in court, they can ask the defendant to be detained without bail.  This is commonly referred to as remand.
 * Data regarding bail is notoriously hard to come by and often poorly maintained.

<section id="grand-jury">

### Grand Jury
[Grand juries](https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/jury-service/types-juries) are special juries that are **empaneled** for a given length of time (usually 30 days) to review evidence and determine if an [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/charging)[^6] is appropriate in a given case. The grand jury reviews the evidence in a case to see if it meets the probable cause standard to issue an indictment. Since the grand jury considers a case before indictment, their work is, at times, done before an individual is even arrested. For this reason, among others, grand jury work is private, not open to the public and does not include the accused or their attorney. These grand juries are also larger than the typical trial jury, which can be from six to twelve people.

<section id="prosecutor-review-starts">

### Prosecutor Begins Reviewing A Case
Once a case arrives at a prosecutor’s office, some offices have a screening unit of prosecutors that reviews a case and determines whether the case should be dismissed immediately, diverted, or moved on for prosecution. Other offices do not have a screening unit and instead send cases directly to prosecuting attorneys, pushing the decision to dismiss, divert or prosecute considerably further into the future.

Cases can be dismissed for any number of reasons, but the most common are:
* Insufficient evidence/lack of evidence 
* Elements not met - here elements refers to the elements of the crime, which are the specific actions that legally define/describe a crime.
* Victim/witness uncooperative/recant - generally affects DV cases. NB - DV cases are notoriously difficult to prosecute and are by far the most commonly dismissed cases.
* Prosecutorial discretion/interest of justice - this is a common, ambiguous code that prosecutors use for everything from a defendant has no prior record and seems a good person to there are issues with the arresting officer i.e. the officer is on a [Brady list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_disclosure).[^7]
* Other reasons a case may be dismissed: death of a defendant; defendant found not competent to stand trial; case moved to another court. 

The above dismissals are initiated by the prosecutor.  Nolle Prosequi is the formal term for this, but also shortened to Nol Pros, Nolle, and other iterations. Some types of dismissals can be determined immediately upon reviewing the case, e.g. elements not met; whereas other reasons for dismissal may arise over time and after prosecution has begun.

**NB - judges may also dismiss cases and generally do so if they find the prosecution’s evidence lacking; this is most likely to happen at a preliminary/probable cause hearing.**

 ### Courts Of First Appearance
 Courts of first appearance vary significantly from jurisdiction. Everything from the timing, to the process, to terminology, to actors involved can all be different between jurisdictions. Given this diversity, the author below presents a generalized outline of these courts based on experience in 4 jurisdictions.
 
 #### Preliminary Hearings
 A preliminary hearing is held after an individual has been arrested. A prosecutor must prove to the judge that there is probable cause to hold a trial. Where a judge does find probable cause, the case proceeds and is “bound over”. In finding probable cause, the judge may change the charges in the case depending on the evidence, including by reducing the severity of the charges. Where a judge does not find probable cause they may dismiss the case.
 
 #### Magistrate Courts/Judges
 In some states, such as Georgia,  magistrate judges will handle most pre-trial matters such as the preliminary hearing, arraignment of charges, and bail. Magistrate courts often handle lower-level criminal and civil cases such as approving warrants, county ordinances, and smaller civil claims. In some states, you do not need a law degree to become a magistrate judge.

<section id="whats-a-case-and-whats-a-charge">
 
 ### What's A Case And What's A Charge
 Cases are made up of charges. A case against an individual generally groups together all the criminal conduct and thus charges from a single incident. This can sometimes be a tricky as it’s debatable where one incident ends and the next begins. For instance, where an individual steals from multiple people at the same time all the charges may be wrapped together into a single case whereas if the individual commits a spree of thefts over time these might be considered separate cases.

Charges are defined by law and consist of ‘elements’. Elements are the component parts of a criminal charge that a prosecutor has to prove. For example, the general definition of burglary is “The unlawful entry of a building or structure with the intent to commit a felony therein.” The elements of burglary are:
* Unlawful entry; 
* Of a building or structure;
* With the intent to commit a felony therein.
A prosecutor then uses facts of the case to demonstrate each element e.g. a person picking a lock would be evidence of an unlawful entry.

 <section id="diverting-instead-of-dismissing-prosecuting">
 
 ### Diverting Instead Of Dismissing/Prosecuting
 If a prosecutor does not immediately dismiss a case, they may divert a case. Diversion generally falls into two categories: true diversion and alternatives to traditional prosecution. 
* __True diversions__ are programs where charges are never filed against the arrestee - sometimes referred to as pre-trial diversion (PTI). In these cases, the diversion can be as nominal as allowing the arrestee to ‘cure’ the harm, e.g. present a driver’s license when facing an arrest for driving without a license. There are more intensive diversions, such as diversions to counseling or neighborhood courts  that remove the arrestee from the prosecution process (though the arrestee can generally be prosecuted at a later date for the crime if they fail the diversion).
* __Alternatives to prosecution__ are more commonly thought of as diversions. Most often these are alternative courts, such as drug court, mental health court, or veterans court. In general, for an arrestee to enter into such a program they are offered diversion as part of a plea negotiation that includes admitting guilt to the crime. The incentive for  admitting guilt is that if the arrestee successfully meets the criteria laid out by the court, the original charge is dismissed and possibly expunged. Most alternatives to prosecution are considered to be under-utilized for a host of reasons - overly burdensome process compared to simply pleading guilty, poor coordination between prosecutors, defense attorneys, and the programs themselves as to eligibility and space, etc.

 <section id="prosecuting-a-case">
 
 ### Prosecuting A Case
 Where a prosecutor decides to prosecute a case, they indict (file charges) against an arrestee. These charges may differ from those the defendant was arrested for based on evidence and elements of different charges.  As such, most data consists of arrest charges and filed charges (and disposition charges which we’ll get to). In some frustrating jurisdictions, arrest charges do not align with prosecution charges, i.e., the codes that law enforcement uses in labeling what the offense was are completely different from the codes that prosecutors use  to prosecute.

After deciding to prosecute a case, the prosecutor and defense attorney will often negotiate a plea where the defendant admits guilt to some charges. In rare instances, cases will go to trial (only 2-3% of cases go to trial).  Most cases  end in conviction on at least some charges. Plea negotiations are often a black box as lawyers are not in the habit of entering offers in a database.  Rather, plea negotiations happen outside any official record. They are a very important part of the system and add a layer of complexity to any analysis as jurisdictions approach them in different ways. They also often result in plea dismissals - a unique type of dismissal that we generally don’t count toward dismissal rate. (A plea dismissal is when a count or counts are dismissed in exchange for the defendant pleading guilty to another count.)

 <section id="disposing-resolving-a-case">
 
 ### Disposing/Resolving A Case
 After a case ends in a plea, a trial, or a dismissal, a case is considered disposed of by the prosecutor.  Diversions are trickier as offices generally consider a case, once diverted, to be disposed in some sense, but the case is not really fully disposed until the individual either successfully completes the diversion or is unsuccessful and the office then either prosecutes or dismisses the case, which represents the final disposition.
 
 #### Sentencing
 Dispositions where the defendant is found guilty then move on to the sentencing phase. Sentencing is complex in that it generally involves the judge, prosecutor, and defense, as well as restrictions laid out in legislation, to determine a defendant’s  punishment. In most cases, defendants can be sentenced to a combination of the following:
* Incarceratory/custodial sentence - The defendant here will either go to prison, or in some cases, may return to jail.  A defendant may be sentenced to incarceration, but receive credit for the time they spent in jail during the prosecution. This credit reduces the amount of time they must serve after the case and, in certain circumstances, may be the entirety of their sentence (“time served” sentences).
* Exposure - The maximum time a defendant can be incarcerated on a given sentence.  Often this number is longer than the actual sentence as defendants are sentenced to serve, for example,  5 years with a maximum exposure of 10 years if they violate their probation upon release. Some sentences come with only exposure and probation, i.e., a defendant is sentenced to 3 years probation with 2 years of exposure to incarceration if they violate that probation.
* Probation - The individual is not in jail or prison, but is subject to probation conditions.
* Fines

All criminal offense codes come with a range of eligible punishment that is laid out in legislation, i.e.,  a “sentencing range” of 0-5 years. The maximum allowable sentences is typically defined by statute.  Some offenses also have a minimum sentence that a judge is required by law to give a defendant. Where charges have a minimum, this is generally referred to as a mandatory minimum.
 
Depending on the prosecutor CMS, court database, and data entry practices, sentences may be entered at the charge level – the ideal – or at the case level. Where sentences are entered at the case level, this can cause confusion for multi-charge cases as to what aspect of the sentence is connected to a particular  charge.
 
Where defendants are convicted on multiple charges each charge may be assigned its own sentence. Where there are multiple sentences that involve incarceration those sentences may be served concurrently or consecutively. Concurrent sentences mean the defendant essentially serves only the length of the longest sentence since all sentences are being served at the same time. Consecutive sentences mean the defendant serves the sum of all the sentences. Whether a defendant is sentenced consecutively or concurrently depends on local rules, practice, and often the judge's choice. Some sentences are required by statute to be served consecutively.
 
This reader does not cover the juvenile system, but suffice to say it is largely the same structure, but with a much greater emphasis on diversion and alternatives to prosecution and less incarceration.

 ### Post-conviction Help
 There are a number of ways people that are arrested or that are convicted of a crime can later clear their record. Most often, these post-case remedies are referred to as sealing and/or expungement. What these terms specifically mean, the process for receiving the remedy, and the actors involved varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In general though:
* Sealed records prevent the public from accessing the record, usually this only affects background checks. This does not generally prevent law enforcement from viewing the record.
* Expunged records generally means deletion of the case from the record. In some cases this might be implemented such that all records of the case are deleted, in other cases just that it cannot be viewed, even by arresting agencies, without some specific purpose.
While both these remedies are very important, very few jurisdictions have thought through and have an effective process for implementing, especially at a technical level of removing or hiding data in the database from specific users. Sealed and expunged cases often thus still show up on background checks and are seen by arresting agencies and prosecutors if an individual is arrested again.

[^a]: For a fuller description of arrests please read Alexandra Natapoff’s Crime Without Punishment, specifically Chapter 3 which does an excellent job describing standard policing while including appropriate legal references.
[^1]: Probable Cause: There was at least a 51% chance that you can show the individual did some illegal act.
[^2]: Beyond a Reasonable Doubt: This is the highest burden of proof (yes, there’s more than probable cause and beyond a reasonable doubt). As a percentage, it’s supposed to be quite high and there should not be any other plausible interpretation of the evidence.
[^3]: Pretextual Stop: The term refers to when the police stop an individual with probable cause for a minor infraction (such as a broken taillight), but the real purpose of the stop was to investigate for other illegal conduct (such as drug violations or weapons offenses).  So long as the officer has probable cause that any violation has occurred, they are legally authorized to make the stop.  Officers then use the stop to develop evidence of other violations (such as smelling drugs) that then provides new probable cause to conduct a search of the vehicle. 
[^4]: Law enforcement assisted diversion: Often used for juveniles, these programs allow police to take an individual directly to some diversion service such as a drug rehab center rather than to jail or a detention center. While charges may be brought against the person eventually, the general idea is to enable the person to avoid a formal arrest and the incident should never reach the prosecutor.
[^5]: Case Management System: A computer program used to track data. For prosecutors, these systems are generally organized around cases and are used by the offices to track defendants, victims, and the charges of a case.
[^6]: Indictment: A formal notice to an individual that law enforcement believes that they committed a crime.
[^7]: Brady list: A Brady violation is a legal violation by the state in failing to turn over exculpatory evidence to a defendant in a criminal matter. It is named after a SCOTUS case Brady v. Maryland. Most often this plays out in police failing to disclose to prosecution and thus defense attorneys evidence pertinent to the innocence of a defendant. This is a Brady violation and can lead to the integrity of the officer being questioned. Prosecutor offices will form Brady lists then of officers with past violations or reputations.
